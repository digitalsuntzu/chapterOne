Clone the repository: Use the git clone command to copy the project to your local machine.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chapterOne.git
cd chapterOne
Install dependencies: The requirements.txt file makes this process simple. You will create a virtual environment to manage dependencies and then install all the required libraries.

Bash

# Create a new virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt
After running these commands, your project will be fully set up and ready to run.

This setup is ideal because it keeps your project dependencies isolated, uses version control, and provides a single, simple command (pip install -r requirements.txt) for anyone to get the project working.


how do i commit and push new changes



To commit and push new changes to your Git repository, you'll follow a three-step process: stage the changes, commit them to your local repository, and then push them to the remote repository (like GitHub).

1. Stage Your Changes
First, you need to tell Git which specific files you want to include in your next commit. This is called staging. You can stage all modified files at once or select specific ones.



To stage all modified and new files:

Bash

git add .
To stage a specific file:

Bash

git add <filename>
git status is a useful command to see which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

2. Commit Your Changes
A commit saves a snapshot of your staged changes to your local repository's history. It's a permanent record of the changes you made. Always include a clear and descriptive commit message.


Bash

git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"
The -m flag stands for "message". Your message should explain what you changed and why.

3. Push to the Remote Repository
Finally, you need to push your local commits to the remote repository (e.g., your GitHub account) to share them and update the online version of your project.

Bash

git push
This command will push your committed changes from the branch you are currently on to the corresponding remote branch. If you are working on the main branch, this is all you need.

For a new repository, you might need to specify the remote and branch the first time you push:

Bash

git push -u origin main
The -u flag sets the upstream branch, so you only have to type git push for subsequent pushes.


You can run the app by running in the main directory: python app.py
